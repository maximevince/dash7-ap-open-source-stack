# RTT Logging

If you are using a platform which uses JLink then logging will be enabled by default and redirect to the fast RTT interface. This interface makes use of JLink connection, meaning you do not need extra wires (UART or USB) for logging.
You can read the logs using `JLinkRTTClient`. This will wait for a JLink connection and print all RTT logs.
Opening a JLink connection can be done using `make jlink-open` in your build directory. Make sure the firmware is built with `FRAMEWORK_LOG_ENABLED` and `FRAMEWORK_LOG_OUTPUT_ON_RTT` enabled.
If you open `JLinkRTTClient` in one terminal and execute `make flash-sensor_push jlink-open` in another this will flash the sensor_push example application and keep the JLink connection open. In the JLinkRTTClient window you will get output like this:

	$ JLinkRTTClient

Note that you can enable different log sources separately by using cmake settings (x_LOG_ENABLED).

On some platforms (eg those based on stm32l0) it seems necessary to reset the node before output starts appearing. You can do this by entering `r` and `g` (reset and go) in the JLink console. 

# RTT logging with multiple targets attached

The `jlink-open` make target assumes there is only one JLink attached to the host system. If you want to open 2 (or more) JLink connections to view the logging of multiple devices, you will need to open a JLink connection manually.
This can be done as shown below:

	JLinkExe -SelectEmuBySN 518007358 -If SWD -Device EZR32LG330F256RXX -AutoConnect 1 -RTTTelnetPort 19021 -Speed 10000

Important to note here are the `-SelectEmuBySN <sn>` and `-RTTTelnetPort <port>` parameters. The first one allows you the specify which JLink adapter to use. The second parameter tells JLinkExe on which port it should listen for RTT clients. You can pass the same parameter to JLinkRTTClient:

	JLinkRTTClient -RTTTelnetPort 19021

This way multiple JLink adapters can be used at the same time, each which a different SN and port.
Note that flashing can done using the JLinkExe prompt as well using the `loadfile` command.
