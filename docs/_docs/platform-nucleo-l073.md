# Programmer support

The board has an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded to flash or debug the board. The ST-LINK debugger is currently not integrated in the OSS-7 build system.
You can use the ST-LINK for flashing by copying the binary to the mass storage device that is created when you attach the board to your PC using an USB cable.

If you want to be able to flash using `make flash-<appname>` it is advised to convert the ST-LINK into a J-Link by using [firmware supplied by SEGGER](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/other-j-links/st-link-on-board/). Besides being able to use the make target to flash,
this also allows logging using RTT (see [here for more info]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/logging.md %})), and also exposes a VCOM port to the system (as does ST-LINK), see below.

# Console location

The serial console on this platform is configured to use UART2 by default. This has the advantage that is useable from the VCOM which is exposed by ST-LINK and JLink (see above).
This means that after plugging in your device using the ST-LINK USB connection you will get a serial interface (next to the USB mass storage device).
This interface can be used for interacting with the console.
Note that, on some Linux system, a service called ModemManager will claim the device upon detection. It will give up after a while, but it will result in communication problems,
each time you plug in. For a workaround look [here](https://linux-tips.com/t/prevent-modem-manager-to-capture-usb-serial-devices/284).
